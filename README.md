## Basic Blockchain Built in Node.js and React.js

A fullstack blockchain built in NodeJs and ReactJS.

The backend hosts a blockchain with mining and wallets that allows end-users to transact to each other's wallets and propagate the transactions over a network via pub-sub capabilities. All wallets follow the Bitcoin cryptographic standards of secp256k1.

The frontend hosts a block explorer running on React JS that allows you to view the blockchain and inspect the mempool.
